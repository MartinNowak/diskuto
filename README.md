- New messages stay at the top for a while to ensure visibility
- Integrates [antispam](https://github.com/rejectedsoftware/antispam) for spam protection
- Generic backend support (currently support for MongoDB is implemented)
- Dynamic UI for replying, editing and deleting comments with JavaScript enabled
- Minimum functionality also works with JavaScript disabled
- Adjusts to the enclosing page's font family, color and size
